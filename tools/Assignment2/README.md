Create web application that returns JSON records of animals. The web application should connect to any database of your choosing, and be able to grab all animals in the database or an individual animal given an id. So if I entered http://localhost:3000/animals/1 That should return a JSON representation of the animal identified by ID 1.

How to run (assuming you have nodejs installed): node server
